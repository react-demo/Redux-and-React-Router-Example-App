### Why
This project was started, because I found myself and many developers would like to get 
an insight on how Redux and React Router can be used in the bigger projects than a TODO app.

Feel free to contribute to make it a great start point for others.

#### Redux
The redux structure follows the [ducks modular redux proposal](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)
