# Introduction

**Why?** This project was started, because I found myself and many developers would like to get 
an insight on how Redux and React Router can be used in the bigger projects than a TODO app.

I also wanted to give a chance to people who want start contributing to open source.

### The Goal
The goal is to build a "fully featured" blog-like application. At the moment the project 
is in the very early stage and I know that is still missing a lot of things.

Please feel free to contribute to the project by sending an issue or a PR, 
so the others can benefit from this project.

### There is more
I plan to document the things we build here so it will be easy for the beginners to understand
how to start.
